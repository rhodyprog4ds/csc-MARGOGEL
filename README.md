# comparison_report

This repo uses [mystmd](https://mystmd.org/guide) to create an interactive report as a website.

It is designed to be used as a [codespace](https://github.com/features/codespaces)

To see the website run in the terminal below: 
```
myst start
```

then view the forwarded port in your browser(go to ports tab below and click the globe that appears when you over over the forwarded address)

<!-- 
To convert notebooks for jupyter style editing run:
```
jupytext --sync models.md
```

or replace `models.md` with the name of your notebook.  
There is an extension that will automatically convert notebooks from ipynb back to myst for you, but you need to create the ipynb version.  -->
